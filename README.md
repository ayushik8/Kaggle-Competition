# Binary Classification Model Report

## Project Overview
The primary objective of this project was to analyze a dataset with patient health indicators in order to build a model to accurately predict smoker status as a binary classification problem. The input data had information on features such as height, age, weight, eyesight, hearing, cholesterol, AST, ALT, GTP, and more health indicators. These features were used to develop and evaluate different binary classification models to assess their ability to predict the smoker status of people based upon their other health conditions. The smoker status was assigned as 0 for nonsmoking and 1 for smoking.
